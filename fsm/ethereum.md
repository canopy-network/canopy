# ethereum.go - Ethereum translation layer for Canopy

[fsm/ethereum.go](./ethereum.go) + and [rpc/eth.go](../cmd/rpc/eth.go) implements the ethereum translation layer for Canopy.

## Overview
Canopy implements an **Ethereum translation layer** that allows popular Ethereum tools (like wallets and explorers) to interact with the Canopy blockchain.

‚á® This layer parses signed Ethereum RLP transactions (including EIP-1559, EIP-2930, and legacy types) and translates them into native Canopy transaction formats.

Special pseudo-contract addresses map common Ethereum function selectors (e.g., transfer(), stake(), unstake()) to equivalent Canopy message types, enabling users to perform common actions like transfers, staking, and swaps through familiar Ethereum interfaces.

üí° While Canopy does not run an EVM, this translation layer **allows EVM compatibility**, particularly for transaction signing, serialization, and tooling but *not bytecode execution*.

## Transactions

### Basic Flow:
1. An Ethereum wallet creates and/or signs an Ethereum RLP transaction
2. Canopy translates the RLP to a standard Canopy transaction and gossips through the peer-to-peer layer like a standard transaction
3. If RLP detected during tx processing, Canopy verifies the Ethereum signature over the RLP bytes and executes the translation protocol over the RLP bytes verifying the expected Canopy transaction and payload.

### Message Types
Using RLP - a user may submit any of the following message types:
- ‚úÖ Send
- ‚úÖ Stake (delegate only)
- ‚úÖ EditStake
- ‚úÖ Unstake
- ‚úÖ CreateOrder
- ‚úÖ EditOrder
- ‚úÖ DeleteOrder
- ‚úÖ Subsidy

### Send Message

‚ö†Ô∏è The send message translation protocol is different than the other messages in Canopy.

**In order to optimize compatibility with existing tooling and centralized exchange integration** - the translation layer accepts the *exact* transfer format of Ethereum and ERC20 transfers.

There are **2 ways** to execute an RLP send:
##### 1. EOA Style:
- `to` is the recipient's 20 byte address in hex format
- `value` is the amount of CNPY in 18 decimal format (anything below 1e12 is 0)
```c
{
    "to": "0xdeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead",
    "value": "0x0de0b6b3a7640000"  // 1 CNPY transfer (minimum is 6 decimals or 1 √ó 10¬π¬≤)
    "input": "",                   // omit
}
```
Importantly, **EOA style uses 18 decimals for values** where `1,000,000,000,000` is the minimum accepted value `1 uCNPY`.
##### 2. ERC20 Style:
- `to` is the pseudo contract address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001`
- `input` is a standard ABI encoded `transfer(address,uint256)`
```c
{
    "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
    "value": "" // omit
    "input": "0xa9059cbb...", // actual transfer ABI encoding
}
```

ABI Example:
```
a9059cbb                                                         (selector)
000000000000000000000000deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead (recipient address left padded)
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000186A0 (1 CNPY amount left padded)
```

Importantly, **ERC20 uses 6 decimals for values** where `1` is the minimum accepted value `1 uCNPY`.

### Other Messages

Unlike the send message translation protocol, other messages translation diverges from Ethereum standards.

‚ûî  Instead of using ABI encoding for the input - an ABI selector prefixes a payload that is encoded in protobuf for **massive space complexity improvements**.

There are 2 additional pseudo-contracts:
##### 1. stCNPY (stake, edit-stake, unstake):
- `to` is the pseudo contract address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002`
- `input` is a standard ABI selector + ‚ö†Ô∏è **protobuf-encoded-message**
```c
{
    "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
    "value": "" // omit
    "input": "0x2d1e0c02...", // ABI selector + protobuf encoded payload
}
```
All protobuf structures may be found in [lib/.proto/message.proto](../lib/.proto/message.proto) and may be used to auto-generate the structures in many popular programming languages like `javascript`.

```proto
// example only: check lib/.proto/message.proto for the most up-to-date messages
message MessageStake {

  // public_key: may omit in RLP as can be recovered from signature
  bytes public_key = 1;
  
  // amount: bonded tokens (6 decimals)
  uint64 amount = 2;

  // committees: is the list of committees the delegator is restaking their tokens towards
  repeated uint64 committees = 3;

  // net_address: must be empty - omit this field
  string net_address = 4; 

  // output_address: address where reward and unstaking funds will be distributed to
  bytes output_address = 5;

  // delegate: must be `True`
  bool delegate = 6;

  // compound: signals whether the delegator is auto-compounding or not
  bool compound = 7;

  // signer: must be empty - omit this field
  bytes signer = 8;
}
```

- StakeSelector is `2d1e0c02` with signature `stake(bytes)`
- EditStakeSelector is `8c71a515` with signature `editStake(bytes)`
- UnstakeSelector is `3c3653e2` with signature `unstake(bytes)`

##### 2. swCNPY (create-order, edit-order, delete-order):
- `to` is the pseudo contract address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003`
- `input` is a standard ABI selector + ‚ö†Ô∏è **protobuf-encoded-message**
```c
{
    "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003",
    "value": "" // omit
    "input": "0xbc2e8e5f...", // ABI selector + protobuf encoded payload
}
```

- CreateOrderSelector is `bc2e8e5f` with signature `createOrder(bytes)`
- EditOrderSelector is `74e78d6f` with signature `editOrder(bytes)`
- DeleteOrderSelector is `6c4650e7` with signature `deleteOrder(bytes)`

<hr/>

Importantly, like an ERC20 transfer - **stCNPY and swCNPY uses 6 decimals for values** where `1` is the minimum accepted value `1 uCNPY`.

Under the hood - if Canopy detects the 'to' address being any of the pseudo-contracts it will process soley based on the selectors.

For `subsidy` the 'recommendation' would be to use the transfer contract `0x000...01` with a the selector: `16d68b09` for signature `subsidy(bytes)`.

## Ethereum JSON RPC Wrapper

`rpc/eth.go` wraps Canopy with the Ethereum JSON-RPC interface as specified here: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc

#### eth_call

Returns `0x` if the `to` value isn't a **Pseudo-Contract** address

Supports the following ERC20 methods:
- `95d89b41` symbol()
- `06fdde03` name()
- `313ce567` decimals()
- `18160ddd` totalSupply()
- `70a08231` balanceOf()
- `a9059cbb` transfer(address,uint256) # only for the transfer contract

Not supported methods:
- `23b872dd` transferFrom(address,address,uint256)
- `095ea7b3` approve(address,uint256)
- `dd62ed3e` allowance(address,address)
- `79cc6790` increaseAllowance(address,uint256)
- `42966c68` decreaseAllowance(address,uint256)
- `40c10f19` mint(address,uint256)

#### eth_filters

Canopy's RPC wrapper fully supports the following methods for `transfers events`:
- [x] eth_newFilter
- [x] eth_newBlockFilter
- [x] eth_newPendingTransactionFilter
- [x] eth_uninstallFilter
- [x] eth_getFilterChanges
- [x] eth_getFilterLogs
- [x] eth_getLogs

However, for non standard - Canopy specific events under the `stCNPY` and `swCNPY` contracts like staking or token swaps, **no events are supported**.

#### eth_blocks and eth_transactions

Canopy's RPC wrapper fully supports the following getter methods for blocks and transactions:
- [x] eth_getBlockByHash
- [x] eth_getBlockByNumber
- [x] eth_getBlockByNumber
- [x] eth_getTransactionByHash
- [x] eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex
- [x] eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex
- [x] eth_getTransactionReceipt

However, it's important to note that block and transaction hashes will correspond to the Canopy block structure, not Ethereum, and some Ethereum fields may be placeholders and some Canopy fields may be missing.

Example: `logsBloom` is a placeholder and `totalVDFIterations` is missing

Also, Canopy combines the Ethereum transaction and receipt structures. In practice, this means additional data may be present - but all calls RPC are fully compatible and satisfied.

  "id": 67,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "blockHash": "0x64e57bce8f087f83efbfcacde6e9afb9fdee8c0319bdbcfc87034bdc4c8574c1",

#### eth_getTransactionCount
‚û™ Canopy implements a non-standard Ethereum-compatible mechanism used by Canopy to support transaction replay protection without maintaining full account nonce history.

*Context:*
- Canopy does not use Ethereum-style monotonic nonces.
- Instead, each transaction includes a `created_at_height` (the block height when it was created), and a timestamp.
- This enables safe pruning and replay protection without requiring persistent per-account nonces.

*BlockAcceptanceRange:*
- Transactions are only valid if their `created_at_height` is within ¬±4320 blocks of the current chain height. (Assuming 20s block times, this represents roughly 24 hours of leeway).

*Implementation:*

- Canopy maintains an **in-memory map** that tracks how many pending transactions have been submitted per address. (Map: `map[string]int` where key = address string, value = pseudo-nonce count)

- Each time a transaction is submitted via `eth_sendTransaction` or `eth_sendRawTransaction`, the count for that address is incremented.

- On every new block:
    - Each count is decremented by 1 (representing aging of pending txs).
    - When the count for an address reaches 0, its entry is removed from the map.

*Purpose in RPC compatibility:*
- `eth_getTransactionCount` is expected by many Ethereum tools and wallets to return a usable nonce.
- Our implementation returns: `LatestBlockHeight + count(address)`
    - This ensures each new tx from a given address gets a unique pseudo-nonce and avoids reuse within the pruning window.
    - Mimics nonce behavior sufficiently for compatibility with Ethereum tooling.
