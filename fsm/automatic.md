# automatic.go

The automatic.go file handles automatic state changes that occur at the beginning and end of a block within the blockchain application. These changes are crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the blockchain as it processes new blocks.

## Overview

This file is designed to manage state changes that are not induced by transactions but are essential for block operations. Key functionalities include starting the block application process and finalizing the block once applied.

## Core Components

### BeginBlock

At the start of a block application, the BeginBlock function is responsible for checking the current protocol version, managing rewards for committees, and processing the results of last block certificates. It ensures that certain conditions are met—like protocol compliance and valid certificates—before proceeding with the state updates. If any validations fail, appropriate errors are returned.

### EndBlock

Once the block has been processed, the EndBlock function executes. It updates the list of last proposers, distributes committee rewards, and unstakes any validators who have reached their maximum paused state. It also cleans up by removing any validators that have finished unstaking. This function ensures that all relevant state changes are applied before closing the block application.

### CheckProtocolVersion

The CheckProtocolVersion function ensures that the protocol version aligns with the governance requirements. It validates that the software version in use is appropriate for the current height of the blockchain, preventing out-of-date or incompatible versions from continuing.

### HandleCertificateResults

As part of the block processing logic, the HandleCertificateResults function manages the results from quorum certificates. It checks the integrity of the committee results and ensures that they reflect the correct state of the blockchain, allowing for secure operation amid the decentralized network.

### ForceUnstakeMaxPaused

This functionality addresses validators who have been inactive for a predetermined period. The ForceUnstakeMaxPaused function allows the blockchain to unpause and remove those validators to maintain network efficiency and security. 

### UpdateLastProposers

To support the leader election process, the UpdateLastProposers function tracks the addresses of the last block proposers. It updates this information as blocks are finalized, maintaining a dynamic record of validator participation.

## Technical Details

The automatic.go file plays a pivotal role in ensuring that state transitions during block applications are handled smoothly and securely. It provides mechanisms for error handling, state validation, and necessary updates to maintain the blockchain's integrity. By automating these processes, the file contributes significantly to the overall effectiveness of the blockchain application.
