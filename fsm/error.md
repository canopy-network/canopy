# error.go - Error Handling for the State Machine Module

This file defines a comprehensive set of error types for the State Machine module in the Canopy blockchain. It provides standardized error creation functions that generate consistent error objects with appropriate error codes, module identification, and descriptive messages.

## Overview

The error.go file implements:
- Standardized error creation functions
- Consistent error formatting
- Categorized error codes
- Module-specific error identification
- Descriptive error messages for debugging and user feedback

## Core Components

### Error Creation Functions

The file consists primarily of functions that create error objects using a consistent pattern. Each function:
- Creates a new error with a specific error code
- Associates the error with the State Machine module
- Provides a descriptive message about what went wrong
- In some cases, wraps underlying errors with additional context

These functions follow a naming convention of `Err[ErrorType]()` and return a `lib.ErrorI` interface, which is Canopy's custom error interface.

### Error Categories

The errors defined in this file fall into several logical categories:

1. **Transaction Validation Errors**: Errors related to validating transactions, such as unauthorized transactions, invalid messages, or insufficient fees.

2. **Address and Key Errors**: Errors related to blockchain addresses and cryptographic keys, such as empty addresses, invalid sizes, or missing public keys.

3. **Validator-Related Errors**: Errors specific to validator operations, such as validators that don't exist, are already unstaking, or are paused.

4. **Parameter Errors**: Errors related to blockchain parameters, including empty or unknown parameters.

5. **Signature Errors**: Errors related to cryptographic signatures, such as invalid or empty signatures.

6. **Protocol and System Errors**: Errors related to the blockchain protocol itself, such as invalid protocol versions or chain IDs.

7. **Committee and Order Errors**: Errors related to committee operations and order processing.

## Technical Details

### Error Structure

Each error in the Canopy blockchain follows a consistent structure:
1. **Error Code**: A unique identifier for the specific error type (defined in the lib package)
2. **Module**: Identification of which module generated the error (in this case, the State Machine module)
3. **Message**: A human-readable description of what went wrong

This structure allows for:
- Easy error identification and categorization
- Consistent error handling across the codebase
- Clear error messages for users and developers

### Error Propagation

Many of the error functions are designed to wrap underlying errors, preserving the original error context while adding additional information. For example:

```go
func ErrTxSignBytes(err error) lib.ErrorI {
    return lib.NewError(lib.CodeTxSignBytes, lib.StateMachineModule, 
        fmt.Sprintf("tx.SignBytes() failed with err: %s", err.Error()))
}
```

This pattern allows errors to be propagated up the call stack while maintaining the full context of what went wrong at each level.
