# error.go

The error.go file contains definitions for various error objects used within the State Machine module of the blockchain project. These error definitions are essential for handling exceptions and conveying specific error conditions in a structured manner.

## Overview

The error handling system is designed to:
- Provide clear and descriptive error messages for various failure scenarios.
- Facilitate debugging and maintenance by categorizing errors based on their context and type.
- Support robust transaction and state management by defining specific error conditions relevant to the blockchain's operations.

## Core Components

### Error Definitions

The error.go file defines a range of error types that are associated with different aspects of the State Machine's functionality. These error types include:
- Errors related to reading and unmarshalling genesis files.
- Transaction-related errors such as unauthorized transactions and invalid transaction messages.
- Address-related errors that handle empty or invalid addresses.
- Proposal and governance-related errors which manage proposals and their validity.
- Validator-related errors that monitor validator states, including existence and unstaking conditions.

### Transaction and State Errors

The error definitions include various conditions that could arise during transaction processing or state management. For example:
- Insufficient funds, which occur when an account does not have enough balance to complete a transaction.
- Invalid parameters during configuration or operations, ensuring that inputs meet the expected criteria.

### Diagnostic and Debugging Support

Each error type includes a descriptive message that provides context about the failure. This information is crucial for developers and users of the blockchain system to quickly diagnose issues and understand what actions led to the error.

## Usage

These error definitions are intended to be used throughout the State Machine module. They enable the system to robustly capture and respond to errors that occur during various operations, improving the overall reliability and user experience of the blockchain application.

In conclusion, the error.go file is a key component of the State Machine, facilitating effective error management and enhancing the system's resilience in the face of operational challenges.
