# Code Flow Analysis Assistant

<task>
You are updating documentation for the Oracle. 

Document the use of each configuration option in lib/config.go for EthBlockProviderConfig and OracleConfig config types.

The config us only used in the oracle package and subpackages. cmd/rpc/oracle

I will detail below the outline of the process. You are to examine each step and detail on safety and integrity measures that have been taken.

## SECTION: cmd/rpc/oracle/eth package

- Analyze receiving blocks
- Next height and safe height usage
- Processing transactions for order data

## SECTION: cmd/rpc/oracle/oracle.go file

- Analyze the run() method
- Analyze order validation in validateOrder(), validateLockOrder(), validateCloseOrder()
- Analyze the method WitnessedOrders
- Analyze the method ValidateProposedOrders

## SECTION: cmd/rpc/oracle/state.go file
- Analyze the method shouldSubmit

For each section analyzed provide a "Key Safety Mechansisms" bullet point list.

Save your results to the file ORACLE_PROCESS.md

<context>
This command performs deep analysis of software components to understand:
- Complete execution flow and data paths
- All processes, functions, and interactions involved
</context>

**Usage**: `/analyze-oracle-flow

## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery
1. **Read Starting Files**: Examine the specified files/packages to understand entry points
2. **Identify Key Functions**: Find main functions, handlers, or processing methods
4. **Define Scope Boundaries**: Use the analysis scope to limit exploration

### Phase 2: Flow Tracing
1. **Execution Path Mapping**: Follow the complete execution flow step-by-step
2. **Data Flow Analysis**: Track how data moves through the system
3. **Control Flow Documentation**: Document decision points, loops, and branches
4. **Inter-component Communication**: Analyze how different parts interact

### Phase 3: Security & Safeguards Analysis
1. **Input Validation**: Examine all input sanitization and validation
4. **Error Handling**: Analyze error paths and failure recovery mechanisms

### Phase 4: Logic & Bug Analysis
1. **Edge Case Identification**: Find boundary conditions and corner cases
2. **Race Condition Analysis**: Look for concurrency issues and timing problems
3. **Resource Management**: Examine memory, file handles, and resource cleanup
4. **State Management**: Analyze state transitions and consistency
5. **Logic Flaws**: Identify potential logical errors or incorrect assumptions

### Phase 5: Documentation & Visualization

## Analysis Instructions

When performing analysis:

1. **Start with the specified files** and use TodoWrite to track your progress
2. **Follow the analysis scope** to avoid going too broad
3. **Use Read, Grep, and Glob tools** extensively to explore the codebase
4. **Create simple mermaid diagrams** for discovered flows

## Analysis Tips

- **Read code comments and documentation** for design intent

Remember: The goal is comprehensive understanding and identification of the flow and the mechanism the control the flow. You are analyzing a complex process that should be present to a user as simple as possible.
