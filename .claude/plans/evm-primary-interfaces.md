Primary Interfaces to Implement:

StateDB - The most critical interface. This is your adapter between the EVM and your custom state storage system.
ChainContext - Provides blockchain-specific context like block headers.
Message - Wraps your custom transaction format for EVM execution.
ChainConfig - Defines which EVM features are enabled at which block numbers.

Key Structs to Construct:

BlockContext - Built from your custom block format
TxContext - Built from your custom transaction format

Optional Interfaces:

PrecompiledContract - For custom precompiled contracts
Logger - For EVM execution tracing and debugging
