**Bridge Vulnerabilities**

## Cross-chain Transfer Protocol Weaknesses

Cross-chain bridges face fundamental security challenges due to their complex architecture spanning multiple blockchain networks.

**Lock-and-mint mechanisms** are particularly vulnerable to smart contract exploits where attackers can manipulate the locking process on the source chain while still receiving minted tokens on the destination chain.

**Message passing vulnerabilities** occur when bridges rely on oracles or relayers to communicate transaction data between chains, creating opportunities for message manipulation, replay attacks, or false transaction confirmations.

**Liquidity pool exploits** target bridges using automated market makers, where attackers can drain funds through flash loan attacks or exploit price manipulation vulnerabilities. Many bridges also suffer from **insufficient validation** of cross-chain transactions, failing to properly verify that funds were actually locked or burned on the source chain before minting on the destination chain.

## Consensus Mechanism Attacks

Bridge consensus mechanisms face unique attack vectors that differ from typical blockchain consensus attacks.

**Eclipse attacks** isolate bridge nodes from the broader network, feeding them false information about the state of connected blockchains and enabling double-spending or fraudulent withdrawals.

**Validator collusion** occurs when a majority of bridge validators coordinate to approve fraudulent transactions or manipulate cross-chain state verification. This is particularly dangerous in bridges with small validator sets or those lacking proper economic incentives.

**Long-range attacks** exploit the fact that bridges must maintain historical state information across multiple chains. Attackers can create alternative blockchain histories and convince bridge validators to accept fraudulent past transactions, potentially draining funds that were legitimately transferred months earlier.

**Finality reversion attacks** target the time delay between when transactions appear confirmed on one chain and when they achieve true finality, allowing attackers to reverse transactions after bridges have already processed them as valid.
