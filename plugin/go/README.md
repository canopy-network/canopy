## ▶ Praxis is a sovereign prediction market protocol built as a Canopy Nested Chain

Praxis ($PRX) lets anyone create YES/NO prediction markets, stake on outcomes, and claim proportional winnings — entirely on-chain, with no platform extraction and no central authority. It is implemented as a Go plugin on the Canopy Network, meaning it runs as an application-specific blockchain with its own state, its own token, and its own transaction types.

## Overview

Praxis implements four on-chain transaction types:

| Transaction | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_market` | Open a new YES/NO prediction market with a question, resolver, and resolution height |
| `submit_prediction` | Stake tokens on a YES or NO outcome for an open market |
| `resolve_market` | The designated resolver finalises a market with the winning outcome |
| `claim_winnings` | Winners claim their proportional payout from the resolved market pool |

All state is stored on-chain in the plugin's key-value store. No database, no backend, no off-chain oracle required for basic operation.

---

## Architecture

Praxis follows the standard Canopy plugin architecture. The plugin runs as a separate process alongside the Canopy node and communicates over a Unix socket using Protocol Buffers.

## State Model

Praxis stores all on-chain data in the Canopy key-value store using byte-prefixed keys:

| Prefix | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `0x10` | `Market` | One record per prediction market |
| `0x11` | `MarketCounter` | Singleton — tracks the next market ID |
| `0x12` | `Prediction` | One record per (forecaster, market) pair |

Built-in Canopy prefixes (`0x01` Account, `0x02` Pool, `0x07` FeeParams) are preserved unchanged.

---

## Transaction Types

### create_market

Opens a new YES/NO prediction market. The creator bonds a stake amount and designates a resolver address. The market remains open for predictions until the resolution height is reached.

```protobuf
message MessageCreateMarket {
  bytes  creator_address   = 1;
  string question          = 2;
  string description       = 3;
  bytes  resolver_address  = 4;
  uint64 resolution_height = 5;
  uint64 stake_amount      = 6;
}
```

### submit_prediction

Stakes tokens on a YES (outcome=1) or NO (outcome=2) outcome. Each forecaster may only submit one prediction per market. The staked amount is added to the corresponding pool.

```protobuf
message MessageSubmitPrediction {
  bytes  forecaster_address = 1;
  uint64 market_id          = 2;
  uint32 outcome            = 3;
  uint64 amount             = 4;
}
```

### resolve_market

Finalises the market. Only the designated resolver address may call this. Sets the winning outcome and closes the market to further predictions.

```protobuf
message MessageResolveMarket {
  bytes  resolver_address = 1;
  uint64 market_id        = 2;
  uint32 winning_outcome  = 3;
}
```

### claim_winnings

Pays out a winner's original stake plus their proportional share of the losing pool. Each prediction can only be claimed once.

```protobuf
message MessageClaimWinnings {
  bytes  claimer_address = 1;
  uint64 market_id       = 2;
}
```

Payout formula:
```
payout = stake + (stake × losing_pool) / winning_pool
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- `protoc` and `protoc-gen-go` (for proto regeneration only)
- A running Canopy node

See the [Canopy Builder Docs](https://canopynetwork.org) for full prerequisites.

### Build

```bash
# Clone and switch to the Praxis branch
git clone https://github.com/Makaveli912/canopy.git
cd canopy
git checkout feat/praxis-prediction-markets

**State Writing**:
```

### Run

```bash
# From repo root
canopy start
```

- **Fee Pool**: Write the updated fee pool.
- **Accounts**: Write the updated sender and recipient records.
- **Drained Accounts**: Delete nonce-zero native senders; retain records with committed nonce state and senders whose nonce will advance after `RLP.V2` delivery.

### Frontend

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory frontend
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. Go to **Node** → set host to `localhost` → Apply. The green dot confirms connection.

Go to **Signer** → paste your BLS12-381 private key → Load Key. Your address will be auto-derived and filled into all transaction forms.

---

## Payout Model

Praxis uses an AMM-style proportional payout. Winners split the entire losing pool in proportion to their contribution to the winning pool.

```
Example:
  YES pool: 600,000 μPRX (forecaster contributed 200,000)
  NO pool:  400,000 μPRX (losing side)

  Forecaster share of YES pool: 200,000 / 600,000 = 33.3%
  Forecaster payout: 200,000 + (400,000 × 33.3%) = 333,333 μPRX
```

If no one bet on the losing side, the winner's original stake is returned unchanged.

---

## Error Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1–14 | Built-in | Standard Canopy plugin errors |
| 15 | `ErrWrongOutcome` | Claimer's prediction did not match the winning outcome |
| 16 | `ErrDuplicatePrediction` | Forecaster already submitted a prediction for this market |

---

## Token

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | Praxis |
| Symbol | $PRX |
| Denomination | μPRX (micro-PRX) |
| Chain ID | 1 |
| Network ID | 1 |

## License

- **Socket Communication**: Low-latency Unix domain sockets
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple state operations in single FSM call
- **Memory Efficiency**: Length-prefixed messaging avoids buffering issues
