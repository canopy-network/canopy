# canoLiq plugin

This package implements the canoLiq liquid-staking sub-chain as a Canopy
plugin. It accepts CNPY deposits, mints cCNPY at the current exchange rate,
applies a 12% protocol fee on staking rewards (split 40/30/15/15 between
users, the canoLiq DAO treasury, validator infrastructure, and CLIQ buyback),
and tracks CLIQ — the fixed-supply (100M) governance token — with cliff +
linear-vesting schedules.

The plugin is a sibling of `plugin/go/contract/`; it reuses the proto types
generated in `contract` package and runs its own FSM connection. See the full
implementation plan at `docs/plans/canoliq-implementation-plan.md`.

## Deployment profiles

canoLiq ships two pre-built deployment profiles. The plugin's
`Config.Profile` field selects which is active and unlocks
profile-specific safety behavior at startup.

| Profile | Config file | Genesis file | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `localnet` | `canoliq-config.localnet.json` | `genesis.localnet.json` | Placeholder addresses (every bucket → single localnet key), 5-block redemption window |
| `testnet` | `canoliq-config.testnet.json` | `genesis.testnet.json` | TODO addresses (must be filled in before deploy), 14400-block redemption window template |

The plugin **refuses to start** with `profile=testnet` (or `mainnet`)
if any genesis bucket recipient still equals the well-known localnet
placeholder address. This catches the most common foot-gun: shipping
the localnet genesis into a real environment by mistake.

The bundled docker compose pins `localnet`. To run against a real
testnet, edit `genesis.testnet.json` with real recipient addresses
and override `CANOLIQ_CONFIG=/app/plugin/go/canoliq/canoliq-config.testnet.json`
in your runtime environment — see "Configuring a testnet deployment"
below.

## Quick start (localnet via Docker)

The fastest path to a running canoLiq chain on your machine — two
Canopy nodes plus a plugin process per node, built and signed by the
bundled `.docker/compose.yaml`. The validator set is pre-seeded so
both nodes are committee-2 (canoLiq) participants out of the box; the
plugin self-bootstraps Genesis on its first `BeginBlock` so 100M CLIQ
supply is minted (to the localnet placeholder address) before you can
hit the RPC.

Prerequisites: Docker (Compose v2) and `curl`. Optional: `jq` for the
JSON examples (or pipe through `python3 -m json.tool`).

### 1. Build the images

From repo root:

```bash
cd .docker
docker compose build
```

This compiles `go-plugin`, `canoliq`, and the canopy node binary into
two images, one per node. First build takes a couple of minutes;
incremental rebuilds are seconds because Go module caching.

### 2. Start the nodes

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Both nodes start, the plugin attaches to its FSM unix socket
(`/tmp/plugin/plugin.sock` inside the container), Genesis runs once,
and rewards begin flowing into the canoLiq committee pool.

### 3. Wait for plugin Genesis

The plugin's `BeginBlock` self-bootstraps Genesis when chain
genesis.json carries no plugin section (which the bundled localnet
does not). Poll until `genesisComplete: true`:

```bash
until [ "$(curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8587/v1/health 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -o '"genesisComplete":true')" ]; do sleep 2; done
echo "ready"
```

This typically takes 6–12s (one to two blocks).

### 4. Probe the read-only RPC

The plugin exposes a read-only HTTP query surface on host port 8587
(node-1) and 8588 (node-2). Both serve the same routes; pick either.

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8587/v1/health   | jq
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8587/v1/globals  | jq
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8587/v1/params   | jq
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8587/v1/pools    | jq
```

After a few blocks of subsidy you should see non-zero `treasuryCnpy`,
`insurancePool`, `buybackPool`, and `validatorIncentives` reflecting
the 12% fee with the canonical 40/30/15/15 split (15% of treasury skim
→ insurance). Conservation: `globals.totalPooledCnpy + treasuryCnpy +
insurancePool + buybackPool + Σ validatorIncentives` equals the
cumulative post-DAO inflow.

The complete route list (snapshot-served + lazy-fulfilled) is in
[Read-only HTTP query layer](#read-only-http-query-layer-phase-3)
below.

### 5. Build `canoliqctl` (for tx submission)

The HTTP query layer is read-only. To submit transactions (deposit,
redeem, stake, vote, etc.) build the operator CLI from the host:

```bash
cd ../plugin/go
go build -o canoliqctl ./canoliqctl/
```

### 6. Submit a deposit

`canoliqctl` fetches the BLS12-381 signer key from the node's admin
keystore (`/v1/admin/keystore-get`), signs, and POSTs the envelope to
`/v1/tx`. It needs the keystore password.

```bash
export CANOLIQCTL_PASSWORD=test   # adjust for your keystore
./canoliqctl deposit <address-hex> 1000000
```

`<address-hex>` is the 40-char hex address for the keystore entry you
want to draft from. The default `--rpc-url=http://localhost:50002`
and `--admin-url=http://localhost:50003` line up with node-1's
exposed ports.

### 7. Verify the tx landed

Re-query the address through the lazy account route:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8587/v1/account/0x<address-hex> | jq
```

You should see `ccnpy` non-zero (depositor received cCNPY) and `cnpy`
debited by `amount + fee`. The route blocks up to one block (~6s)
while EndBlock fulfills the lookup.

### 8. Tear down

```bash
cd ../../.docker
docker compose down
```

State persists in `.docker/volumes/node_*/canopy/` between restarts.

### Resetting to a fresh chain

Plugin Genesis runs once and short-circuits on subsequent boots
(idempotent on `globals.GenesisComplete`). To force a clean re-run
(regenerates 100M CLIQ supply, zeroes pools, replays subsidies from
height 1):

```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf volumes/node_*/canopy volumes/node_*/logs
rm -f  volumes/node_*/book.json volumes/node_*/polls.json
docker compose build   # if you changed code
docker compose up -d
```

Keep the other files (`config.json`, `genesis.json`, `keystore.json`,
`validator_key.json`, `proposals.json`) — those are config/identity,
not mutable state.

### Ports

| Service | node-1 | node-2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Wallet | 50000 | 40000 |
| Explorer | 50001 | 40001 |
| RPC | 50002 | 40002 |
| Admin RPC | 50003 | 40003 |
| canoLiq plugin RPC | 8587 | 8588 |
| Debug pprof | 6060 | 6061 |
| Metrics | 9090 | 9091 |
| TCP P2P | 9001 | 9002 |

### Common pitfalls

- **`/v1/health` returns `genesisComplete: false` forever.** Either
  the plugin can't read its `genesis.json` (check `CANOLIQ_CONFIG`
  env var inside the container) or `Config.GenesisPath` is empty. The
  bundled compose sets both correctly; check
  `docker compose logs node-1 | grep -i canoliq` for plugin errors.
- **Empty reply from `/v1/...`.** Plugin process probably crashed.
  Check `docker compose logs node-1 | grep -iE 'fatal|panic|code:.*107'`.
  A `code 107: plugin response id is invalid` indicates a
  freestanding StateRead from outside an FSM lifecycle window — this
  was an early-design bug fixed by the snapshot model; if it
  reappears, see `AGENTS.md` and the saved memory.
- **Lazy routes time out (504).** Chain has stalled — `EndBlock` is
  not firing. Check that committee 2 has at least one validator
  opted in (the bundled genesis seeds two; if you've edited it,
  confirm `MessageEditStake` ran).

## Configuring a testnet deployment

The localnet quick-start above mints 100M CLIQ to one placeholder key
and uses a 5-block redemption window. Both are wrong for any shared
chain. The testnet profile keeps the same plugin binary but loads a
distinct genesis + runtime config, with safety checks that refuse to
start until placeholders are replaced.

### 1. Replace bucket recipient addresses

Edit `plugin/go/canoliq/genesis.testnet.json`. The seven buckets must
sum to 10000 bps; recipients within each bucket must also sum to
10000 bps. Replace each `address` (currently
`0000…0001` … `0000…0007`) with the real owner address (multisig,
custody wallet, etc.) for that bucket.

### 2. Replace multisig signers

In the same file's `params` block, swap the placeholder
`00000000…b1` … `00000000…b5` for the real signer addresses, and
adjust `multisigThreshold` if you list a different number. These
signers control above-`treasuryThreshold` DAO spends — pick them
carefully.

### 3. Set the redemption window

Edit `canoliq-config.testnet.json` `redemptionUnstakingBlocks` to
match the live Canopy chain's `valParams.UnstakingBlocks`. The
template ships with `14400` (~24h at 6s blocks); adjust if Canopy
testnet runs at a different block time or unstaking length.

### 4. Pick a chainId

Coordinate with the Canopy team to pick a free committee chainId for
canoLiq on the target chain. Update `chainId` in
`canoliq-config.testnet.json` (default `2`).

### 5. Verify safety locally

Build and run the plugin briefly with the testnet config to confirm
the startup banner reports your edits and the safety check passes:

```bash
cd plugin/go && go build -o go-plugin .
CANOPY_PLUGIN_MODE=canoliq \
  CANOLIQ_CONFIG=$PWD/canoliq/canoliq-config.testnet.json \
  ./go-plugin
# Expect first log line: canoliq: profile="testnet" chainId=… genesis=…
# If any placeholder address remains, the process exits with:
# canoliq: refusing to start profile="testnet" with localnet placeholder
# address in bucket "<name>" (set real bucket recipient addresses in …)
```

The plugin will block trying to connect to the FSM socket — that's
fine for the safety-check verification. Kill with Ctrl-C.

### 6. Deploy

Two paths, depending on how you run Canopy nodes:

- **Direct (recommended for testnet):** start the canopy binary with
  `CANOLIQ_CONFIG=/path/to/canoliq-config.testnet.json` in its
  process env. The plugin loads the testnet config on first
  `BeginBlock`.
- **Docker, custom compose:** copy `.docker/compose.yaml` to e.g.
  `compose.testnet.yaml`, swap the `CANOLIQ_CONFIG` line to
  `…/canoliq-config.testnet.json`, and bring up via
  `docker compose -f compose.testnet.yaml up -d`. The Dockerfile
  already bundles both genesis + config variants, so no rebuild is
  needed — only the env-var override.

### 7. Coordinate with Canopy

Before the chain processes its first canoLiq block:

1. Validators add `chainId` to their `Validator.Committees[]` via
   `MessageEditStake` (Canopy's existing restaking flow).
2. Submit a `MessageSubsidy` proposal so the Canopy DAO funds the
   committee reward pool. Until this passes, the canoLiq pool stays
   empty and `ProcessRewards` is a no-op.
3. Post a design summary (chainId, fee/split, bucket distribution,
   plugin runtime contract) to the Canopy Discord per
   `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Profile safety check details

`SafetyCheck` runs immediately after the startup banner. Under
`profile=testnet` or `mainnet` it parses the genesis file and refuses
to proceed if any bucket recipient address (case- and prefix-folded)
matches the localnet placeholder
`851e90eaef1fa27debaee2c2591503bdeec1d123`. The check does not
validate that addresses are *correct* — only that they're not the
known-bad localnet seed. Genesis-schema validation (bps sums,
required fields) runs separately inside `validateGenesis`.

Localnet (or empty) profiles skip the check entirely.

## Building

```bash
cd plugin/go
make build                        # builds the plugin process: ./go-plugin
go build -o canoliqctl ./canoliqctl/   # builds the operator CLI: ./canoliqctl
```

The same `go-plugin` binary serves either the send tutorial or canoLiq based
on the `CANOPY_PLUGIN_MODE` environment variable:

| Value | Plugin |
|---|---|
| `` (unset) or `contract` | send tutorial |
| `canoliq` | canoLiq liquid staking |

Optionally point `CANOLIQ_CONFIG` at a JSON file with `chainId`, `dataDirPath`,
and `genesisPath` overrides.

## canoliqctl — operator CLI

`canoliqctl` builds, signs, and submits canoLiq plugin transactions to a
running Canopy node. It uses the node's admin keystore (`/v1/admin/keystore-get`)
to fetch the BLS12-381 signer key and POSTs the signed envelope to `/v1/tx`.

Global flags (also configurable via env vars `CANOLIQCTL_RPC_URL`,
`CANOLIQCTL_ADMIN_URL`, `CANOLIQCTL_NETWORK_ID`, `CANOLIQCTL_CHAIN_ID`,
`CANOLIQCTL_FEE`, `CANOLIQCTL_PASSWORD`):

```
--rpc-url      node query RPC (default http://localhost:50002)
--admin-url    node admin RPC, hosts the keystore (default http://localhost:50003)
--network-id   Canopy network id (default 1)
--chain-id     canoLiq committee chain id (default 2)
--fee          tx fee in uCNPY (default 10000)
--password     keystore password — required
```

Phase 1 worked example (deposit → redeem → claim once unbond matures):

```bash
export CANOLIQCTL_PASSWORD=hunter2
./canoliqctl deposit alice 1000000           # 1 CNPY → cCNPY
./canoliqctl redeem  alice 250000            # burn 0.25 cCNPY, queue redemption
# advance past unbond_complete_height (Canopy's UnstakingBlocks param)
./canoliqctl claim   alice 0                 # claim redemption #0
```

Phase 2 commands (governance, staking, buyback, treasury):

```bash
./canoliqctl cliq-stake          alice 5000000
./canoliqctl cliq-unstake        alice 1000000
./canoliqctl cliq-claim-unstake  alice 0
./canoliqctl vote                alice <proposal-id> yes
./canoliqctl buyback-execute     alice <proposal-id>
./canoliqctl spend-execute       alice <proposal-id>
./canoliqctl multisig-approve    signer1 <spend-id>
./canoliqctl cliq-transfer       alice <to-hex> 1000000
./canoliqctl cliq-claim-vested   alice
```

### Creating proposals

`proposal-create` dispatches `MessageCLIQProposalCreate` with one of three
`google.protobuf.Any` payload types. The proposer must hold ≥
`min_stake_to_propose` CLIQ at creation height.

```bash
# 1. Param change — full-set CanoliqParams replacement (loaded from JSON)
./canoliqctl proposal-create param-change alice ./new-params.json \
    --description "lower fee from 12% to 8%"

# 2. Buyback — CNPY → CLIQ extraction at a vote-set price
./canoliqctl proposal-create buyback alice 100000000 1500000 burn \
    --description "Q4 buyback and burn"
# args: cnpy-amount  price-uCNPY-per-CLIQ  mode (burn|distribute)

# 3. Treasury spend — transfer from canoliq treasury to a recipient
./canoliqctl proposal-create treasury-spend alice 0xabc...123 50000000 cnpy \
    --description "infrastructure grant"
# args: recipient-hex  amount  denomination (cnpy|cliq)
```

The `param-change` JSON file uses the same shape as the `params` block
in `genesis.localnet.json` / `genesis.testnet.json`; copy that block to
a file, edit, and pass the path. `multisigSigners` are accepted as hex
strings (with or without `0x` prefix), exactly like the genesis files.

The plugin's `dispatchPassed` runs `ValidateParams` on the payload only
when the proposal passes — so an invalid bps split or signer/threshold
mismatch in your JSON survives `proposal-create` but fails at execution.
Pre-validate by ensuring the four split bps fields total 10000 and
`multisigThreshold ≤ len(multisigSigners)`.

## Registering canoLiq as a Canopy committee

1. **Pick a `chainId`.** Ensure it does not collide with an existing committee
   in your Canopy instance. The default is `2`; override via `CANOLIQ_CONFIG`.
2. **Validators opt in.** Each participating validator submits a
   `MessageEditStake` adding the canoLiq `chainId` to its
   `Validator.Committees[]` list. This is Canopy's existing restaking flow —
   no fork required.
3. **Request a subsidy.** Submit a `MessageSubsidy` proposal so the Canopy DAO
   funds the canoLiq committee reward pool. The plugin's `EndBlock` hook
   reads from this pool and applies the 12% fee.
4. **Run the plugin.** Set `~/.canopy/config.json` `"plugin": "canoliq"` (or
   start the binary directly with `CANOPY_PLUGIN_MODE=canoliq`). On first
   boot the plugin runs `Genesis` once, minting the 100M CLIQ supply to the
   recipients in `genesis.json` according to the bucket weights and vesting
   schedules.

## Genesis configuration

`genesis.json` lists CLIQ allocation buckets and per-recipient weights. The
sum of bucket bps must be `10000`; recipients within a bucket must also sum
to `10000`. Buckets with `cliffMonths == 0 && vestMonths == 0` mint to a
liquid CLIQ balance immediately; otherwise the plugin writes a
`VestingSchedule` and the recipient must call `MessageCLIQClaimVested` to
unlock vested CLIQ. Update the placeholder hex addresses (`...a1` … `...a7`)
before running mainnet.

## Transaction reference

| Tx | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MessageCanoliqDeposit` | Deposits CNPY → mints cCNPY |
| `MessageCanoliqRedeem` | Burns cCNPY → queues `Redemption` (matures after the unstaking window) |
| `MessageCanoliqClaimRedemption` | Withdraws a matured `Redemption` to the user's CNPY account |
| `MessageCLIQTransfer` | Transfers liquid (vested) CLIQ |
| `MessageCLIQClaimVested` | Unlocks newly-vested CLIQ across all of the caller's vesting schedules |
| `MessageCLIQStake` | Locks liquid CLIQ for governance weight |
| `MessageCLIQUnstake` | Queues an unbond record; voting weight drops immediately |
| `MessageCLIQClaimUnstake` | Returns matured CLIQ to the liquid balance |
| `MessageCLIQProposalCreate` | Opens a governance proposal (param change \| buyback \| treasury spend) |
| `MessageCLIQVote` | Votes yes/no/abstain on an active proposal |
| `MessageBuybackExecute` | Triggers a passed buyback proposal (BURN or DISTRIBUTE_STAKERS) |
| `MessageDAOTreasurySpend` | Triggers a passed treasury spend (timelock + multisig above threshold) |
| `MessageMultisigApprove` | Per-signer approval of an above-threshold spend |

The plain `MessageSend` is also accepted so the canoLiq plugin is a drop-in
replacement for the tutorial when the `CANOPY_PLUGIN_MODE=canoliq` binary is
selected.

## Governance lifecycle

CLIQ holders stake CLIQ for governance weight (and yield boosts in a future
release). All material protocol parameters — fee bps, the 40/30/15/15 split,
buyback mechanics, multisig membership, validator-onboarding criteria — flow
through the same proposal pipeline.

1. **Stake.** `MessageCLIQStake` locks liquid CLIQ; `staked_at_height` is
   recorded on the `CLIQStake` record. Unstake decrements voting weight
   immediately and queues an unbond record maturing after
   `cliq_unstaking_blocks` (default ~7 days).
2. **Propose.** `MessageCLIQProposalCreate` accepts a typed `google.protobuf.Any`
   payload — one of `ProposalParamChange`, `ProposalBuyback`, or
   `ProposalTreasurySpend`. The proposer must hold ≥ `min_stake_to_propose`.
   Total staked CLIQ is snapshotted into `Proposal.snapshot_total_staked`.
3. **Vote.** `MessageCLIQVote` casts a yes/no/abstain weighted by the voter's
   `CLIQStake.amount` *as of the proposal's creation height*. Stake added
   after creation is rejected (defeats flash-stake attacks).
4. **Tally.** On `BeginBlock` after `expiry_height`, the plugin tallies
   weights and applies the rules:
   - **Quorum**: `yes + no + abstain ≥ quorum_bps × snapshot_total_staked / 10000`
     (default 33%).
   - **Pass threshold**: `yes ≥ pass_threshold_bps × (yes + no) / 10000`
     (default 50%+1).
5. **Execute on pass.** Param-change payloads update `CanoliqParams` immediately
   and are observed by the next `ProcessRewards` sweep. Buyback and
   treasury-spend payloads write self-contained `BuybackOrder` / `TreasurySpend`
   records that subsequent triggers (`MessageBuybackExecute`,
   `MessageDAOTreasurySpend`) drain.

## Buyback workflow

Phase 2 ships an internal accounting swap (whitepaper §6 allows "market
buyback and burn or direct distribution governed by DAO"). A real on-chain
DEX route is deferred to Phase 3.

A passed `ProposalBuyback` carries `cnpy_amount`, `price_micro_cnpy_per_cliq`,
and `mode`. `MessageBuybackExecute`:

- Drains up to `cnpy_amount` from `canoliq/buyback/pool` and credits
  `canoliq/treasury/canoliq` by the same.
- Computes `cliq_acquired = cnpy_amount * 1_000_000 / price_micro_cnpy_per_cliq`
  and debits `canoliq/treasury/cliq` (DAO 15% bucket).
- **BURN**: decrements `globals.cliq_total_supply` and
  `globals.cliq_circulating_supply` by `cliq_acquired`.
- **DISTRIBUTE_STAKERS**: pro-rata credits all active CLIQ stakers' liquid
  balances; rounding remainder credited to the largest staker.

Re-execution is a no-op (`BuybackOrder.executed` flag).

## Treasury spend workflow

`ProposalTreasurySpend` carries `recipient`, `amount`, and `denomination`
(CNPY or CLIQ). Below `treasury_threshold` the spend executes as a single
step; above threshold it requires:

- A `timelock_blocks` delay before `executable_height` is reached.
- ≥ `multisig_threshold` of `multisig_signers` recording approvals via
  `MessageMultisigApprove`.

Initial multisig signer set is configured in `genesis.json`; subsequent
membership and threshold changes flow through a `ProposalParamChange`.

## Insurance fund

`ProcessRewards` skims `insurance_bps` (default 1500 = 15% of the treasury
slice → ≈1.5% of fee) into `canoliq/insurance/pool` per WP §11. Phase 3 will
add slashing-reimbursement disbursement; Phase 2 only seeds the pool.

## Per-validator pro-rata

The 15% validator-incentive slice is now distributed proportionally across
the canoLiq committee validator set, sourced from a plugin-internal
`ValidatorRegistry` singleton. Phase 1.5 will replace the registry source
with a real Canopy validator-set readback. When the registry is empty the
legacy aggregator key (`KeyForValidatorIncentives(committeeAggregatorAddr)`)
holds the full share — Phase 1 baseline behavior.

## State key layout

All canoLiq keys live under prefix `[]byte{10}` to stay clear of Canopy core
prefixes (`1`=accounts, `2`=pools, `7`=gov). See `state.go` for the helper
functions and key composition.

## Read-only HTTP query layer (Phase 3)

The plugin owns all canoLiq-prefixed state and is the only process that
can read it. To expose plugin state to operators and dashboards, a small
read-only HTTP server runs **inside the plugin process** alongside the
FSM unix socket.

Enable it by setting `CANOLIQ_RPC_ADDR` (or `Config.RpcAddress`) to a
listen address. Empty/unset disables the server.

```bash
export CANOLIQ_RPC_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8587
CANOPY_PLUGIN_MODE=canoliq ./go-plugin
```

The bundled Docker compose binds the plugin RPC to `0.0.0.0:8587` inside
each container; host ports are `8587` (node-1) and `8588` (node-2).

### Snapshot model

The Canopy FSM rejects plugin-initiated `StateRead` calls whose request
ID is not from an in-flight FSM lifecycle call. Freestanding reads from
an HTTP handler therefore cannot work. Instead, the plugin builds a
**snapshot** of canoliq-owned state inside `EndBlock` (where the
FSM-originated request ID is valid) and HTTP handlers serve from that
frozen snapshot — no plugin↔FSM round-trip per request. The snapshot is
swapped atomically (`sync/atomic.Pointer[Snapshot]`).

Consequence: query responses are **stale by up to one block**. For
liquid-staking monitoring, that is acceptable — operators care about
trends, not single-block precision.

Cold start (before the first `EndBlock`) returns sane defaults: zero
height, `genesisComplete=false`, `DefaultParams()`.

### Routes (all `GET`)

Snapshot-served (sub-millisecond, stale by ≤1 block):

| Path | Returns |
|---|---|
| `/v1/health` | `{height, genesisComplete, chainId}` |
| `/v1/globals` | `CanoliqGlobals` (singleton accounting record) |
| `/v1/params` | `CanoliqParams` (governance-tunable knobs) |
| `/v1/pools` | committee pool, treasury (CNPY/CLIQ), buyback, insurance, per-validator incentives |
| `/v1/proposals` | `{ids: [active proposal ids]}` |
| `/v1/proposal/{id}` | full `Proposal` record (404 if not in active set) |
| `/v1/spends` | `{ids: [pending spend ids]}` |
| `/v1/spend/{id}` | `TreasurySpend` record |
| `/v1/spend/{id}/approvals` | multisig approvals filtered to the *current* signer set |
| `/v1/validators` | `ValidatorRegistry` (committee snapshot used for pro-rata) |
| `/v1/stakers` | `{stakers: [{address, amount, stakedAtHeight}]}` from `CLIQStakeIndex` |

Lazy-fulfilled per-address (latency: up to one block ≈ 6s on localnet):

| Path | Returns |
|---|---|
| `/v1/account/{addr}` | composite: CNPY + cCNPY + liquid CLIQ + stake + validator-incentive + vesting |
| `/v1/vesting/{addr}` | every vesting schedule with cumulative unlocked-to-date |
| `/v1/redemption/{addr}/{id}` | one redemption record |
| `/v1/vote/{id}/{voter}` | one vote record |
| `/v1/buyback/{id}` | post-execution `BuybackOrder` |

Errors: `400` malformed input, `404` missing entity, `405` non-`GET`,
`500` internal error, `503` lazy queue saturated, `504` lazy drain
timed out (chain stalled).

The lazy routes block the HTTP request until the next `EndBlock`
drains the query queue. Client disconnects (e.g. via `ctx` timeout)
cancel the wait promptly. Pending unstakes and per-address
redemption listings are *not yet* exposed — they'd need new
write-side indexes; tracked as future work.
